## Summary
The Spread of fake news is a global issue. In an age where the internet is commonly used as the primary source of information, news consumers are more likely than ever to come across and share fake news. Consumers all around the world read, watch, or listen to the news every day for updates on everything from their favorite celebrity to their favored political candidate, and they typically assume that what they discover is accurate and trustworthy. It is a very difficult and time consuming approach for detecting fake news by a human himself. A machine learning model can help people to detect fake news within a very short time. As a result, fake news detection has become a very popular topic for the researchers. In this work, two methodologies have been proposed to detect the Bangla fake news, which are hashing and hashing-autoencoder. Hashing transforms a text into a set of indexes that has a fixed size. It puts the features in a smaller dimensional space. It reduces the original high dimensional space by mapping the features to hash keys. Autoencoder is a neural network to clean up noisy or sparse data. The input vector is rebuilt by moving from a high-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional space and then back to a higher-dimensional space. The new methodologies have been compared to traditional methodologies using natural language based neural networks such as LSTM & GRU and hybrid networks CNN-LSTM & CNN-GRU. Some machine learning models also have been used such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree & Passive Aggressive Classifier with random parameter tuning and ensemble based methods such as Voting & Boosting. The Logistic Regression, the Light Gradient Boosted Machine and the CNN-LSTM hybrid network perform better by giving the accuracy of above 90% for detecting the fake news.

## Contribution
The main contribution of this work is in the feature extraction part of the methodology. The main contribution of this thesis/project are:

`- Using the hashing trick for the feature extraction from the text corpus. In general, TF-IDF, bag of words, word embedding, etc. techniques are being used widely for feature extraction. For both ML and DL algorithms hashing is used. For the large data set, it has improved the performance of the model significantly.`

`- Using the hashing-autoencoder technique for ML algorithms. With the help of a hashing trick we used an autoencoder technique for regeneration of the input for reducing the sparsity of the input vectors. It has improved the modelâ€™s performance in a more balanced way than only using the hashing trick.`

`- Finding the best learning model for detecting the fake news from the Bangla news corpus using the proposed methods.`

## Basic Framework Overview

Figure shows the basic overview of the proposed system. Here we use both ML and DL models with feature extraction techniques commonly used TF-IDF technique and word embedding, rarely used `hashing trick` technique and also a `hashing-autoencoder model` for reconstructing the input vector for various ML models which are Logistic Regression, Passive Aggressive Classifier, Decision Tree algorithm and ensemble learning like Voting Classifiers, Boosting algorithms etc. In DL models, we have used both LSTM, GRU and also hybrid networks with CNN-LSTM, CNN-GRU. Among them the hashing trick for feature extraction is totally new for Bangla Fake News Detection, and hashing autoencoder for both feature extraction & input regeneration is totally new for fake news detection of any language corpus. These two types of proposed system have been outperformed over other traditional approaches with the performance of detecting fake news.
